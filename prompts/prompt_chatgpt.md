# Prompt for Generating Single-Speaker Narration Script

## Context
This prompt was used to transform Syracuse Women’s Basketball 2024–25 season statistics into a **single-person narration script** suitable for CapCut’s TTS (Text-to-Speech), which only supports one voice.

## Prompt
*"I only have one chance to generate speech audio using CapCut’s TTS, and it only supports a single voice. Please rewrite the previous street-interview Q&A script into a **one-person narration style**, like a sportscaster or news anchor. It should summarize the key highlights of Syracuse Women’s Basketball 2024–25 season, including team record, top scorer, leading rebounder, best three-point shooter, assist-to-turnover leader, toughest and most impressive wins, and end with a strong one-word description of the team."*

## Output (Generated Script)
The model produced a narration covering:
- Overall record (**12–18**, home **8–8**)  
- Top scorer (**Georgia Woolley, 16 PPG, 463 total points**)  
- Top rebounder (**Kyra Wood, 6.8 RPG**)  
- Best three-point shooter (**Sophie Burrows, 39.6%**)  
- Best assist-to-turnover ratio (**Dominique Camp, 2.21**)  
- Key wins (**66–61 vs. Miami, 93–87 at Virginia Tech**)  
- Closing description: **“Resilient”**  

This script was then used to generate the final `SWW.mp3` audio file located in the `media/` folder.
