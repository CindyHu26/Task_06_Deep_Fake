# Task_06_Deep_Fake

## Project Overview
This project is part of **Research Task 6: Deep Fake**, where the main objective is to transform a narrative or dataset summary into an AI-generated ‚Äúdeep fake‚Äù interview. The emphasis is not on the final polished product, but rather on documenting the **process, tools, and workflow** explored during the task.

For this attempt, I worked with the **2024‚Äì2025 Syracuse University Women‚Äôs Basketball Cumulative Statistics** dataset.

## Workflow & Process

### Step 1: Data Source
- I uploaded the official PDF containing the **2024‚Äì2025 Women‚Äôs Basketball Cumulative Statistics** to **NotebookLM** (Google‚Äôs experimental AI notebook tool).

### Step 2: Narrative Creation
- Instead of manually writing a new script, I utilized NotebookLM‚Äôs **‚Äúvideo summary‚Äù function** to generate an initial narrative.
- This function automatically produced a short summary video of the statistics, which I used as the base material for the deep fake interview.
- The output can be accessed here:  
  üëâ [NotebookLM Generated Video Summary](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/7f30a502-367a-4a9f-b9c5-c80bcd00e1a3?artifactId=8a99c3b1-7654-4ede-b73b-c501f3073dde)

### Step 3: Interview Concept
- The goal was to reframe the statistical summary into a simulated **interview format**:
  - **Interviewer questions**: focusing on season highlights, player performance, and key takeaways.
  - **Interviewee answers**: drawn from the NotebookLM-generated summary.

### Step 4: Media Generation
- Since NotebookLM generated a video summary, I treated this as my **first experiment in creating a synthetic interview.**
- Although this was not yet a full ‚Äústreet interview‚Äù or multi-speaker conversation, it provided a foundation for converting narrative into **audio-visual media.**

## Tools & Resources
- **NotebookLM (Google AI Notebook)** ‚Äì for data upload and video summary generation  
- **Source Data**: 2024‚Äì2025 Syracuse Women‚Äôs Basketball Cumulative Statistics (official PDF)  
- **Output**: AI-generated video summary (treated as initial deep fake attempt)

## Challenges & Reflections
- NotebookLM‚Äôs video summary feature is limited in customization (e.g., cannot fully control speaker roles, voices, or interview flow).
- This attempt helped me explore how existing AI tools can automatically transform **structured data** into **media outputs.**
- For the next iteration, I plan to:
  - Refine the **interview script** manually
  - Use free **TTS (text-to-speech)** tools for multiple voices
  - Optionally combine with a free AI video generator to simulate a talking-head interview
